    <h2>country <span class="normal">barn</span></h2>
    <p>This traditionally inspired country ‘barn’
kitchen features an island in contrasting
country buttermilk. Looking around this
kitchen many special features are evident -
the elegant ‘corbelled’ overmantle, the special
lattice and glazing bar dresser doors, the
keystone open shelf and wine rack units, as
well as three types of pilasters. The overall
effect, combined with subtle distressing,
makes a uniquely crafted and special kitchen.
